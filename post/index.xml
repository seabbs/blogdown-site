      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://seabbs.co.uk/shiny/thepebblegame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Pebble Game&lt;/a&gt; is a shiny application that simulates a simple game which has been designed  to reflect real world epidemics and the vaccination programmes used to control them. It involves repeatedly drawing pebbles from a bag, which contains two distinct pebble types (to represent vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals). The number of pebbles that are drawn each round is dependent on the number of infect-able (i.e unvaccinated) cases drawn in the previous round, and the infectiousness of the simulated disease. Each game can then be thought of as a single stochastic (with a random element) epidemic, by combining multiple simulations of the game, the dynamics of the system can be understood. Hopefully by playing the game and exploring the app you will gain an insight into how a single vaccination can contribute to protecting the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-a-single-game&#34;&gt;Playing a single game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to understand what is being simulated, hopefully if you have just played the game with me in person you should have a good idea of this! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t played the game with me, and the simple explanation above wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough then see the instructions for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/thepebblegame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;playing the game physcially&lt;/a&gt; (click on the how to play the game tab)- it might even be worth giving it a go at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/thepebblegame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open the app&lt;/a&gt;. Your screen should then look like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/img/single_game.png&#34; alt=&#34;The game simulation tab from the pebble game app&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be looking at 10 simulations of the pebble game, each with 100 pebbles, 60% of pebbles being vaccinated, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reproduction number&lt;/a&gt; of 3 (don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is - try hovering over it in the app). These parameters can all be varied (hit the plus in the game parameters box), although if you add more stones or more simulations it may take awhile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph on the right summarises each simulation, recording the number of pebbles in each generation. You should notice that some paths are darker blue than others, this indicates that multiple simulations traced the same pathway. From this you should see that there are two distinct solutions, a rapid die out of the disease or an epidemic that infects everyone (try varying the parameters to see what effects they have on these &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;steady states&lt;/a&gt;). To get a clearer picture of this try setting the summary statistic to plot to the number of pebbles, this will show how the disease spreads with each generation (known as the epidemic curve).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark blue line, and shaded ribbon, summarise all your simulations (using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;95% confidence intervals&lt;/a&gt;), whilst this is helpful it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always tell the full story! This is because if you have diverging solutions, as in this example, a single summary statistic cannot accurately represent either of them and instead represents an overview of the system. This is a well known problem in statistics so watch out for it cropping up elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below the graph helps with this problem by providing a variety of summary measures, including the number in each generation, the number of generations, the total number infected, and the percentage of unvaccinated pebbles  that are infected. Each one of these is presented with several measures (mean, median, 25%, and 75% quantiles), this allows you to get an understanding of the distribution (which you can&amp;rsquo;t get from a single point estimate). In this example you should see that mean number of generations is about 7, which parameters effect this measure? Can you vary the parameters so that the mean is still about 7 but the other summary measures change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to investigate an epidemic using the app. A common goal of vaccination programmes is to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population that a disease cannot cause an epidemic. The lower bound for this is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vaccination thresold&lt;/a&gt;, which can often be found mathematically. By varying the parameters of the game you should be able to estimate this threshold! The key question is now what factors influence this vaccination threshold (try varying the game parameters)? Once you&amp;rsquo;ve investigated all the parameters try looking up some real world diseases (for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/understand-the-measles-outbreak-with-this-one-weird-number/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;) and seeing how the vaccination threshold of your disease compares to theirs. Why do you think it is different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-diseases&#34;&gt;Comparing diseases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you further explore the effects of varying parameters on the outcome of the pebble game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/thepebblegame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Pebble Game app&lt;/a&gt; has an additional tab (Compare diseases). This lets you simulate two diseases, each with an individual reproduction number, but otherwise using the same parameters. An example, comparing a disease with a reproduction number of 3 and another disease with a reproduction number of 12 can be seen below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/img/compare_game.png&#34; alt=&#34;The disease comparision tab from the pebble game app&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output in this tab is very similar to that in the Play the game tab, but there is now a graph of both diseases, as well as for each disease separately. In this example we see that the second disease has a much lower generation time, than the primary disease. However even for this much slower disease in over 25% of simulations all of the unvaccinated pebbles are still infected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-exploration&#34;&gt;Ideas for further exploration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in exploring the pebble game further then here are a few ideas of what to questions to investigate;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What effect does varying the number of simulations have? Are there parameters for which this has a greater impact? If so what implications does this have for real world diseases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you identify stages of an epidemic by looking at plots of the number of pebbles  in each generation? At which stage is the disease most likely to die out? What does this mean for epidemic control?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What features of epidemics is the Pebble Game not capturing? How do you think these features might influence the results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post was a useful introduction to the Pebble Game and to the simple dynamics of infectious disease dynamics and vaccination.

      <title>An ancient disease, a scar, and classroom mathematics</title>
      <link>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/an-ancient-disease-a-scar-and-classroom-mathematics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/an-ancient-disease-a-scar-and-classroom-mathematics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How are a 10,000-year-old disease, the scar on your arm (if you are over 25 and born in the UK), and the mathematics you learnt at school related? If you are under 25, where is your scar? My research uses mathematics to understand the role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine in preventing Tuberculosis (TB) in England and forecast the impact of current policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB is one of the oldest human diseases, with recorded cases in ancient Egypt, renaissance Europe, and in the modern day across the globe. The disease is spread through the air, when people with active TB cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. Classic symptoms include a chronic cough with fever, night sweats, and weight loss. After an initial infection, an individual may immediately develop active TB or enter a latent stage from which active TB may develop years later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thought that roughly one-third of the world&amp;rsquo;s population has been infected with TB, with 1% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population being infected annually. However, the vast majority of these cases will never develop active disease. This reservoir of disease presents a challenge for control and eradication as, even if transmission can be halted, new cases will still occur for many years to come. While many people might consider TB to be a problem of the past in England, in 2015 there were 5,758 notified cases, the majority of which occurred in vulnerable communities; where incidence rates can be as much as 15 times higher than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCG vaccine was developed in 1921 and was introduced to the UK in 1953. Globally, it has been shown to offer variable protection that may reduce over time. However, there is strong evidence that BCG offers high levels of protection for children, and more generally within the UK born population. It remains the only TB vaccine with over 100 million doses given globally each year. Serious side effects are very rare but scarring commonly occurs at the site of injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the UK withdrew the universal BCG program for those at school age and introduced a targeted program of vaccination for babies that were deemed to be at high risk. This was motivated by several years of declining transmission, the evidence of high levels of protection in children and a belief that other control measures would be more cost-effective. Since this change in policy, declining incidence appears to support this decision. However, due to TB’s complex dynamics, the long-term effects are difficult to predict. More recently there has been a global shortage of the vaccine, which has led to some at risk children not being vaccinated; the potential effects of which are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of data is revolutionising the way we view the world; in few other areas has this revolution been felt more than in public health. In 2000, Public Health England launched a routine surveillance system for TB, which records demographic, clinical, and microbiological information on all notified cases. This dataset allows us to study the details of TB epidemiology in England more easily than ever before. Whilst this information would present much of interest by itself, by combining it with other datasets we can adjust for the changing demographics of the English population to study the trends in TB over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research has two strands. The first of these is aimed at understanding the current impact of BCG on TB in England. This involves investigating evidence that suggests BCG vaccination may improve outcomes for those who have developed active TB and estimating the direct effects of the 2005 change in vaccination policy. These results will enable policy makers to gain a greater understanding of the role of BCG vaccination in England and hopefully facilitate future decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strand uses the power of simple mathematical systems to reproduce complex dynamics. Examples of these techniques can be seen in modelling the weather and understanding the shoaling behaviour of fish. In infectious diseases, mathematical models have been used for over 100 years but have recently become increasingly data driven. By developing simple models, harnessing secondary school level mathematics, I am attempting to explain some of the patterns in TB incidence that have been observed in England over the last 15 years, in the context of changing vaccination policy. The simplicity of these models means that hypothetical scenarios can be explored, via simulation, and forecasts of future TB trends made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is nothing if not a collaborative process. Whilst mathematical models provide a powerful analytical approach, without expert knowledge and good data they can produce meaningless results. While my focus is BCG vaccination, the key lesson from my PhD has been the importance of working across disciplines in order to access expert knowledge and unlock the power of mathematics to solve real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The temptation of a long loan; Risk and rewards of term length</title>
      <link>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/temp-long-loan/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/temp-long-loan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a quick update to last weeks post this week we will be using the estimates of bad debt from last week to assess the true risk/rewards of loans at various lengths from the funding circle (FC) loan book. I realised recently that when picking loans my default criteria tends towards picking loans with the lowest percieved risk (i.e lowest risk band) with the highest interest rates possible. This strategy has some interesting consequences in that it preferentially selects long term loans that tend to have higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FC surfaces the average bad debt rate by risk band and not by the term of the loan. Whilst this is a simplifying assumption that makes the investing process easier to understand, for it to be true short term loans must be inherantly riskier than long term loans, or the risk of default must be decoupled from time. Both of these assumptions seem unlikely to me,  and in a later past we will be looking further at the lifecourse of loans, but for this week we will simply be using my function for estimating for bad debt individually for each term length. As discussed last time we estimate the percentage of bad debt by comparing the proportion of bad debt, with total debt, accounting for loan size, the principal remaining, and the interest paid on the loan. This approach also has the same caveats as last time in that it does not account for future recoveries by funding circle, and so becomes increasingly inaccurate for more recent loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first identify the possible loan terms available to borrowers in the FC ecosystem, and the number in each category. We see that by far the most common loans terms are those, as might be expected, that are an integer number of years. For clarity we restrict ourselves to looking at these most common loans (6, 12, 24, 48, 36, and 60 months), stratifying by risk band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;7199&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2435&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1578&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;244&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;231&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-temp-long-loan/figure-html/est_bad_rate_risk-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Estimated bad debt rate, accounting for repayments and the principal remaining, for the 6 most common term lengths straitifed by risk band&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that the assumption that short term loans are higher risk is only true for loans of 6 months, and for E loans of 12 months, which have a much greater risk of bad debt than all other loans. However these loans are relatively rare so this may be an artifact of low statistical power. For all other loan lengths we see that the risk of bad debt increases, with time with loans that are 36 months and over accounting for the majority of the bad debt in all risk categories. As I have not accounted for the maturity of loans, this apparent trend may be driven by the differing ages of loans in different years. Therefore we repeat the above but now stratify further by year, dropping loans with 6 month terms for clarity. Whilst this does add some variation the overall trend appears to hold with longer term loans having significantly higher proportions of bad debt, this is particularly true of E loans, where 60 month loans have much higher bad debt rates than those with shorter terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious point to note is that FC adjusts interest rates by term length, so that longer term loans have higher rates, this adjustment is obviously to account for the disparity in risk over loan term. In a follow up post I will be using these estimates of bad debt by loan term to evaluate the return on loans of difffernt term lengths to assess whether these adjustments sufficiently account for the increased risk of longer term loans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Estimating the risk of bad debt in the funding circle loanbook</title>
      <link>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/fc-risk-bad-debt/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/fc-risk-bad-debt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are again looking at the peer to peer (P2P) loan book for funding circle (FC), with the focus being the variation in return based on portfolio composition and diversification. FC states that the average return on investment is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/statistics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;6.6%&lt;/a&gt;,  with 93% of investors that invested in more than 100 companies, with a maximum exposure of 1% earning 5% or more. The original purpose of this blog was to look at various portfolio&amp;rsquo;s and estimate the risk that they carry for the investor. A key component of this is an understanding of the bad debt rate and it&amp;rsquo;s variation over time, which proved more complex to estimate than expected. This post will be looking in detail at various measures of the bad debt rate and raising questions for future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FC states that the average bad debt rate across all risk categories is 1.8% (after bad debt recovery), and that 42% of all defaulted loans are recovered. Across the platform the average risk of default for each risk band is 0.6% for A+ loans,  1.5%    for A loans, 2.3% for B loans, 3.3% for C loans, 5.0% for D loans, and 8.0% for E loans. In order to optimise a portfolio, that both minimises risk and maximises profit a complete understanding of these risk levels is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FC estimates bad debt rates by taking the actual bad debt rate by loan amount, incorporating the estimated bad debt rate for years that have not matured, and then including the expected recoveries that are expected from each year of origination. Whilst the source of these estimates has not been surfaced it is likely that the estimated bad debt for loans that have not matured is estimated from previous years, whilst the the FC statistics page states that average recoveries are 42% of the defaulted amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these assumptions we start by roughly calculating the bad debt rate, looking solely at the number of loans that defaulted in a given year and comparing this to the total number of loans. This is obviously a flawed approach as it does not account for loan size, repayments, recoveries, or the maturity of the loan. However it represents a crude initial estimate of the default rate in each risk category. This approach yields far higher estimates of bad debt, than those estimated by FC. To account for the variability in loan size we repeat the above steps but this time account for loan size. This approach can further be refined by accounting for loan repayments prior to the loan defaulting. There are multiple approaches to this, the first of which is to adjust for the amount recovered from defaulted loans, another option is to instead estimate the proportion of bad debt from the principal remaining. Finally by looking at the term length of the loan, and the number of repayments made I can estimate the amount of interest payed on a loan and use this to offset the loss made by the loan defaulting. This assumes that interest is payed on the total loan amount as opposed to the amount outstanding (therefore this measure will slightly underestimate the levels of bad debt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-fc-risk-bad-debt/figure-html/estimate_loanbook_bad_debit-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Estimated bad debt by year, using various methodologies&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this approach we find higher estimates for bad debt using every approach than that estimated by funding circle, this may be due to the differing approaches used or from user error! Reassuringly the most complex approach, that includes the interest payed on loans and the amount payed of the principal gives the closest estimates to those given by funding circle. I have made no adjustments for loans that have not matured, so decreasing bad debt overtime does not necessarily indicate a trend. I have also not accounted for future recoveries by FC which may substantially reduce the proportion of bad debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate this further I have estimated the bad debt rate for each risk category using all the approaches discussed above. As can be seen below this yields estimates of bad debt that are greater than those estimated by FC, interestingly this is not true for E risk loans, indicating that year of loan origination may be a factor (as E loans are the most recently offered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-fc-risk-bad-debt/figure-html/est_bad_rate_risk-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now focussing on just using the most complex model for bad debt, we see that early investors suffered from poor risk categorisation by funding circle with high default rates across all risk bands. This indicates that holding newly introduced products to term may result in higher than expected loses, although cash back programs may compensate. Bad debt then stabilises indicating successful classification of loans into credit bands. However, these estimates are still higher than those estimated by funding circle, though this maybe due to the exclusion of future recoveries from my estimation model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future blogs I will be further exploring loan risk and attempting to investigate investor risk in a variety of portfolio structures. I am particularly interested in exploring the default rate of loans over time, as increasing risk may indicate some beneficial strategies. Let me know if you have any blog ideas, some potential areas are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding estimated default for newly acquired loans, coupled with a range of scenarios for loan recoveries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan default risk over the loan period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of property interest only loans to an ordinary FC loan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trade off between loan length and interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately future analysis may be limited by the limited dataset released by FC, as key dates are not including in the public loan book. Hopefully if there is sufficient pressure more data will be released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog series will be bi-weekly, please comment with suggestions of topics. The code for this post can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/seabbs/funding_circle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visualising the funding circle loanbook</title>
      <link>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-vis-fc-loanbook-md/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-vis-fc-loanbook-md/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of blog posts looking at P2P lenders, which will be aimed at surfacing more details about the structures of their loan books. I hope to expand this series by looking at optimal strategies, predictive modelling, and interactive data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2005, with the launch of &lt;a href=&#34;www.zopa.co.uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zopa&lt;/a&gt; P2P companies have provided a middle path between cash holdings, and investing in stocks and shares. Funding circle, which was launched in 2010, has currently facilitated over £1 Billion in loans to British businesses. It has also returned on average 6.6% after the exclusion of bad debt, fees etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform offers small, and medium businesses loans of up to £1 million, for up to 60 months. Whole or fractional loans are then purchased by individuals/institutions. Since September 2015 loans have been offered with fixed rates determined by FC using the risk category of the company, and the loan terms. There is also a secondary market where individuals can sell loan parts, for a 0.25% fee, at a premium, at parity, or at a discount. Prior to September 2016 loans were auctioned with no fixed rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FC allows the investor to hand pick each loan that they invest in, and the level of your exposure. However investors can also use an automated auto-bid tool that automatically buys loans, on both the primary and secondary markets, based on pre-set options specified by the investor. These include selecting risk levels to lend to, selecting rates to buy loans on the secondary market, and specifying a target maximum exposure to any single loan. These two system lead to a tension, with those that are hand-picking loans being potentially able to manipulate the auto-bid algorithm acting for other investors. As part of this blog series I will be looking further into these strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some simple visualisations of the FC loan book, with the first step being to load the required packages (unhash for first run).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;#install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;)
library(tidyverse)

#install.packages(&#39;lubridate&#39;)
library(lubridate)

#install.packages(&#39;stargazer&#39;)
library(stargazer)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to load in the data and display the variable names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;## File path of loanbook 
df_path  &amp;lt;- &#39;~/data/Funding_circle/loanbook.csv&#39;

## Load data with miss spec as N/A
loanbook &amp;lt;- read_csv(df_path, na=&#39;N/A&#39;)

## var to factors
factor_list &amp;lt;- c(&#39;status&#39;, &#39;credit_band&#39;, &#39;loan_purpose&#39;, &#39;sector&#39;, &#39;business_type_name&#39;, &#39;region_name&#39;, &#39;whole_loan&#39;, &#39;repayment_type&#39;, &#39;security_taken&#39;)
                 
                 
format_factors &amp;lt;- function(factor_list, df){
                   for (var in factor_list)
                   {
                     df[[var]] &amp;lt;- factor(df[[var]])
                   }
                   
                   return(df)
}
loanbook &amp;lt;- format_factors(factor_list, loanbook)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We print the simple summary of the data as a first step (hidden for brevity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;summary(loanbook)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the loan book has evolved with time an immediate question is how the number of loans, at each risk level has changed with time. Across all risk bands we see that year on year loan acceptances have increased, with 2016 showing by far the largest growth. Notably we see the introduction of D loans in 2013, and the introduction of E loans in 2015. The vast majority of funding circle loans are with &amp;lsquo;low risk&amp;rsquo; borrowers (i.e A, and A+), although the number of risky loans is now greater than the entire loan book in 2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt; #Plot incidence - by year
loanbook %&amp;gt;% 
    mutate(month = floor_date(loan_accepted_date, &amp;quot;month&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
        count(month, credit_band) %&amp;gt;% 
        ggplot(aes(x=month, y=n, fill=credit_band)) + 
          geom_area() -&amp;gt; p1
p1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-vis-fc-loanbook-md/figure-html/offer-year-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now aggregate by month so that we can understand patterns of loan acceptances across the risk bands. For all risk bands we see that there is a increasing trend towards the end of the year, with the fewest loans originated in April, and March, indicating that this may not be a good time to move funds into FC, and consequently this may lead to an up-tick in the secondary market. E loans show the strongest growth in the second half of the year - however this may be an artefact of their relatively recent introduction, which maybe responsible for this apparent trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;loanbook %&amp;gt;%
        mutate(month = month(loan_accepted_date, label=TRUE)) %&amp;gt;%
        ggplot(aes(x=month)) + 
          geom_bar() + 
            facet_wrap(~credit_band, scale=&#39;free&#39;) + 
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45)) -&amp;gt; p2
p2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/2017-06-10-vis-fc-loanbook-md/figure-html/monthly-risk-band-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we aggregate by day. There is limited evidence here that loan acceptances vary between weekdays, with a slight upward tick mid week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;loanbook %&amp;gt;%
        mutate(day = wday(loan_accepted_date, label=TRUE)) %&amp;gt;%

&lt;p&gt;To link these trends to demand from investors we plot the average interest rate of each accepted loan. We see that average rates are linked with supply for historic loans that were accepted using the biding system. However as expected since the introduction of the fixed rate loan system supply is now uncoupled from price, this presents possible advantages for the hand-picking investor who can buy loans at times of peak supply and sell loans at times of scarcity at a premium on the secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;plot_monthly_risk_band &amp;lt;- function(df, years)
{
  df %&amp;gt;%
        mutate(month = month(loan_accepted_date, label=TRUE)) %&amp;gt;%
           mutate(year = year(loan_accepted_date)) %&amp;gt;% 
                filter(year %in% years) %&amp;gt;% 
                   group_by(month, credit_band, year) %&amp;gt;% 
                      summarise(`Avg interest rate`=mean(interest_rate)) %&amp;gt;% 
                          ggplot(aes(x=month, y=`Avg interest rate`, shape=credit_band, color=credit_band, fill=credit_band, group=credit_band))  +
                              geom_line() +
                                facet_wrap(~year, scale=&#39;free&#39;) +

  return(p)
}
