## Project Requirements

This site is built with the [**blogdown** package](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which can be installed using `blogdown::install_hugo()`.

The blog is built on the [hugo-academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme.

This website is built in a container using the [tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/) docker image. To run the docker image run:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker pull seabbs/seabbs.github.io:sources

docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name seabbs.github.io -e USER=seabbs -e PASSWORD=seabbs seabbs/seabbs.github.io:sources
```

The rstudio client can be found on port `:8787` at your local machines ip. The default username:password is seabbs:seabbs, set the user with `-e USER=username`, and the password with ` - e PASSWORD=newpasswordhere`. The default is to save the analysis files into the user directory.
