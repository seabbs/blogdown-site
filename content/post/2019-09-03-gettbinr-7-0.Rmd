[`getTBinR 0.7.0`](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/) should now be available on CRAN. This release includes some new experimental data (TB incidence by age and sex) that for now is only partly supported by `{getTBinR}`. It also brings `{getTBinR}` into line with new (or new to me) `{ggplot2}` [best practices](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html). This involved two major changes:

1. Moving from a full `@import` of `{ggplot2}` to only using `@importFrom` for required functions (something that I had previously been too lazy to do...).

2. Dropping `aes_string`, which is now soft depreciated, in favour of `aes` and `rlang::.data` for programmatic variables (Note: *Yes I could have more fully embraced `rlang` here but this would have required some major breaking package changes*). This was a real joy as `aes_string` has always been a bit clunky to use and resulted in very messy looking code. A simple pseudo-code example of this can be seen below.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

## Variable to plot
y_var <- "disp"

## Old getTBinR approach for programming across variables
ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = "cyl", y = y_var)) + 
  geom_point()

## New getTBinR approach using rlang
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = .data[[y_var]])) + 
  geom_point() +
  ## This is now needed to get the correct label - a small price to pay.
  labs(y = y_var)

```

Wrapping up this release are several bug fixes for the embedded `{shiny}` app and `{rmarkdown}` report. The full change log is included below (or can be found [here](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/news/index.html)). See the bottom of this post for an example of using the new age and sex stratified incidence data. 

## getTBinR 0.7.0

## Feature updates

* Added experimental support for incidence data stratified by age and sex. Current implementation requires data cleaning before use. See the release post for details.

## Package updates

* Fixed a bug that was preventing `render_country_report` from producing a country level report. Added tests to flag this in the future.
* Updated the packages requested for installation by `run_tb_dashboard` so that `render_country_report` runs without errors.
* Switched to using `ggplot2` best practices ([#77](https://github.com/seabbs/getTBinR/issues/77)).
* Updated the README to make identifying types of badges easier.

## Example: % of TB incidence in each age group

The code below downloads the new experimental (and in its raw form messy) incidence data stratified by age and sex. As these data are in a different format to the rest of the data in `{getTBinR}` some cleaning + aggregation is needed to get it into a workable form. From there it is a simple task to use `{getTBinR}` to produce a global map of the % of TB incidence in each age group. 


```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Get required packages - managed using pacman
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)
p_load("getTBinR")
p_load("dplyr")
p_load("tidyr")

##Pull TB data 
tb_burden <- get_tb_burden(additional_datasets = "Incidence by age and sex",
                           verbose = FALSE)

## Aggregate incidence by age group
tb_burden_ag <- tb_burden %>% 
group_by(age_group, country, year) %>% 
summarise_at(.vars = vars(inc_age_sex, inc_age_sex_lo, inc_age_sex_hi), sum) %>%
full_join(
  select(tb_burden, -sex, -age_group, -contains("inc_age_sex")) %>%
    unique
  ) %>% 
ungroup %>% 
  add_count(age_group, country, year, wt = inc_age_age) %>% 
  mutate(inc_age_dist = inc_age_sex / n * 100)



map <- map_tb_burden(tb_burden_ag, metric = "inc_age_dist", 
                     metric_label = "% of TB incidence in each age group",
                     facet = c("age_group")) +
  labs(title = "Global summary of the % of TB incidence in each age group")
