Most of my work involves mathematical models of infectious diseases, and related studies to determine parameters of interest. I am particularly interested in the incoperation of complex vaccination dynamics into models of infectious disease, and in computational methods for confronting methods with data. More specific aspects of my research are listed in the following, see also the list of publications, and blog posts for more details.

### *Investigate the evidence used to justify the policy change from universal school age to selective neonatal BCG vaccination, and estimate the present and future impact of this change*

This work aims to investigate the evidence used to justify both the reduction in coverage, and the retargetting of the vaccination campaign. 

*Collaborators:* Hannah Christensen, Ellen Brooks-Pollock

### *Determine the evidence for associations between BCG vaccination and outcomes for active TB cases*

The principal aim of this study is to identify the evidence, within the UK, of additional effects of the BCG vaccine. Currently the effectiveness of vaccination is determined by its reduction in active Tuberculosis cases alone, evidence indicating additional effects would mean that this would need to be reassessed

*Collaborators:* Hannah Christensen, Ellen Brooks-Pollock

### *Forecast the impact of BCG shortages, optimise the policy response to these shortages, suggest policy changes to limit future shortages*

As the BCG is a live vaccine it is susceptible to production shortages, globally there is currently a shortage of BCG vaccines. This means that the UK has been unable to implement its vaccine program, most recently in 2015. There is currently little evidence to support policy making in this are, this work aims to provide policy makes with relevant evidence.
